            <p>
                Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.

            <p>The history of Java is very interesting. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced technology for the digital cable television industry at the time. The history of Java starts with the Green Team. Java team members (also known as Green Team), initiated this project to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions, etc. However, it was best suited for internet programming. Later, Java technology was incorporated by Netscape.
                <br>
                The principles for creating Java programming were "Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, Secured, High Performance, Multithreaded, Architecture Neutral, Object-Oriented, Interpreted, and Dynamic". Java was developed by James Gosling, who is known as the father of Java, in 1995. James Gosling and his team members started the project in the early '90s.

                Currently, Java is used in internet programming, mobile devices, games, e-business solutions, etc. Following are given significant points that describe the history of Java.

            <header>Parameters of java</header>
            <p>Some of the basic parameters of Java are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>class keyword is used to declare a class in Java.</li>
                <li>public keyword is an access modifier that represents visibility.</li>
                <li>static is a keyword. If we declare any method as static, it is known as the static method. The core advantage of the static method is that there is no need to create an object to invoke the static method. The main() method is executed by the JVM, so it doesn't require creating an object to invoke the main() method. So, it saves memory.</li>
                <li>void is the return type of the method. It means it doesn't return any value.v</li>
                <li>main represents the starting point of the program.</li>
                <li>String[] args or String args[] is used for command line argument. We will discuss it in coming section.</li>
                <li>System.out.println() is used to print statement. Here, System is a class, out is an object of the PrintStream class, println() is a method of the PrintStream class. We will discuss the internal working of System.out.println() statement in the coming section.</li>

            </ul>
            <code>
                public class HelloWorld {

                    public static void main(String[] args) {
                       // Prints Hello, World! on standard output.
                       System.out.println("Hello World!");
                    }
                 }

        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Object_class">
            <header>Object Class</header>
            <p>The Object class is the parent class of all the classes in java by default. In other words, it is the topmost class of java.

                The Object class is beneficial if you want to refer any object whose type you don't know. Notice that parent class reference variable can refer the child class object, know as upcasting.
                
                Let's take an example, there is getObject() method that returns an object but it can be of any type like Employee,Student etc, we can use Object class reference to refer that object.<br><br> For example:
                
                Object obj=getObject();//we don't know what object will be returned from this method  <br>
                The Object class provides some common behaviors to all the objects such as object can be compared, object can be cloned, object can be notified etc.</p>
                <code>
                    public class Puppy {

                           // This constructor has one parameter, name.
                           System.out.println("Passed Name is :" + name );

            <header>Methods in java</header>
            <p>A method is a block of code or collection of statements or a set of code grouped together to perform a certain task or operation. It is used to achieve the reusability of code. We write a method once and use it many times. We do not require to write code again and again. It also provides the easy modification and readability of code, just by adding or removing a chunk of code. The method is executed only when we call or invoke it.

                The most important method in Java is the main() method.</p>
